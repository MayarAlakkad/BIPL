Disable-NetAdapterBinding -Name “interface name” -componentID ms_tcpip6

This command is used to import users in active directory (-k makes sure that the import process doesn’t stop when a error occurs)
Csvde -i -k -v -f “filename”
Ldifde -I -k -v -f “filename”

Import users from CSV using powershell
Note: you have to make sure that the tool rsat-adds has been installed using the command

Linux
To change the owner user/group of a folder/file use the command
Sudo chown user:group “path to folder/file”

Chmod numbering
1 = execute | 2 = Write | Read = 4

This command enables group inheritance from the parent directory (if the group owner of the parent folder is example then the group owner of the childitem becomes example) 
sudo chmod g+s

To search from root folder “/” to file named passwd use the following command
sudo find / -name passwd

to search in the whole filesystem to files with the SID bit enabled as root
sudo find / -user root -perm -4000

these are examples of disk management programs
cfdisk, fdisk, parted, blkid, lsblk

This command is used to show the partitions and the used space/available space in a partition
df -h

this command check the filesystem
fsck.[ext2, ext3, ext4]

To create a Logical volume from a volume group
lvcreate -L 1GB -n logical-volume-name volume-group-name

to create a symbolic link
Ln -s source-file symbolic-name

Week 5
Windows Server
Note: when using server manager, you manage the servers as the logged in user in Windows on the client or on the server itself
Note: Don’t!!!!! ever add a new network card to a domain controller and turn it off without configure it to function in AD!!! This will fuck your whole AD. If you do that, you’ll get the error that you cannot authenticate with the AD Domain Admin account (user name or password incorrect error). The solution is to disable the interface and restart the Domain controller
